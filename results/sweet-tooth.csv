Sweet Tooth
=============
Chill_Panda,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sweet-tooth/reviews/1417777,"“Its a dry woody pungent flowery taste and smell. If you have massive depression you'll want to do SweetTooth. It has an outstanding knack for making you feel better, very sticky and dense round nuggets in deep green & orange hairs. These compact buds give you the smell of fruit and spicy flowers. Do not pass up Sweet Tooth, but bring a jug of water this strain will make you thirsty.”"

From the first time I saw that densely packed green and orange sticky crystal goodness, I knew she had to be mine. I don’t usually fall for hybrids and so I was beside myself with anxiousness. You see, I’ve only ever been with sativas. It can’t be that different right? She’s not a full indica. One of her parents had to be sativa. I’m just gonna throw it out there, I act...”"

Let me just say that this weed does not make you feel like an insane clown, as one reviewer here has suggested. Unlike like my co-host on the Voice singer/songwriter Miley Cyrus, this weed is very good at numbing the pain of existence.

I'm on the payphone tryin...”"

After 2 to 3 bowls I was lit and probably could've stopped smoking and been okay, but it was so tasty that me and my buddy smoked for about two hours. As you can imagine we were beyond high, we were destroyed. Highly recommend this for a euphoric and giggly high, I was laughing constantly. Overall I gave it a 9, defiantly worth the purch...”"

Just two hits outta my tiny glass pipe, and I was full of energy. I cleaned my entire house and did not have any of my usual pain. Sweet tooth is a great strain for energy and pain reduction.”"

I like the strain so much that I kept a male in a separate, isolated location and used its pollen to seed a few buds on my Mendo Purps, Romulan Queen, Covelo Sour Diesel, Bubblegum females, as well as with a Sweet Tooth girl. I'm excited t...”"
LegitLogic,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sweet-tooth/reviews/1393466,"“Sweet Tooth is an amazing hybrid leaning on the sativa dominant side with very powerful effects. This strain is really an all day kind of smoke yet it can lay you out but also keep you uplifted and focused at the same time. It's definitely a must try for all and I find it best for just relaxing playing video games and such. It also helps alot with anxiety, spasms & depression. Definitely a 5 star strain that cannot b...”"

nickrazza,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sweet-tooth/reviews/1341926,"“Buds dense over 8-9 weeks, leaving a moist resinous product to cure beautifully. Nugs are dark green, with an array of crystals and assortment of orange hairs. The smell is sweet, but has an overall fruity skunk aroma. Taste is one to match, or closely resemble and trich's hold onto buds very well! 
High is very 50/50, with a mid-range creep over the body, to the shoulders and head evenly and one to keep active throu...”"

It made me very happy, talkative, and creative. We were all laughing non-stop about all the funny things we were coming up with. The smoke wasn't too harsh and I don't recall any sort of taste to it, which is fine by me.  All my stresses where gone for the two hours or so while I was medicated. Make sure you hav...”"

Flowery buttery taste comes from more of the rare Vintage Diesel Indica. Now that tastes like butter and super Rose/ Lavender taste, if you have had Vanilla Kush you can taste the Lavender almost the same smell/ taste. Except at the end note it's a light sour no...”"

Without a doubt the best strain I've smoked to this day.”"
Sir Kinsey III,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sweet-tooth/reviews/1076792,"“First time smoking Sweet Tooth and it's unlike any bud I've ever smoked. A perfect blend of body stone and head high. The effects definitely creep up on you. One hit didn't seem to do anything but I wanted to be sure so I waited and oh baby did it hit me later. Very effective medicine for nausea and gastrointestinal problems. However, not one to use if you need to get up and about, as the couch lock is second to none...”"
chiefboydom,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sweet-tooth/reviews/1380893,"“Smoking out of a backwoods right now and the effects are really intensified. First few hits are very heady and body stimulating and goes on to be a euphoric trip the rest of the way through. Was in a bad mood but now my thoughts are uplifted and I have to say I'm not too hungry right now but it sets in later. The sativa dominant effects are pleasing and it's indica properties ease you into a relaxing body high.”"

That doesn't surprise me at all because this pretty little bud was the perfect daytime buzz for me. This made me feel inspired and motivated, not weighed down, anxious, or tired.

bleafnmiracles,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sweet-tooth/reviews/1319236,"“Very nice indica, one of my new favorites. Great for pain. Even though this is a "balanced" strain, it is very potent with a strong body sensation (but not overwhelming), perfect for my chronic pain issues. The sweet tooth I picked up is just above 26% thc.

CiNDER,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sweet-tooth/reviews/1076811,"“Pretty good head buzz, but kind of a heavy feeling. Excellent for my lower back pain but made problem solving activities more difficult and made me pretty lethargic, so its not a bud you would want to smoke if you have things to get done. Good strain to relax to and spend the evening gazing out the window.”"

Cursed,https://www.leafly.com/indica/sweet-tooth/reviews/1169807,"“Great for daytime/early evening pain & relaxation without the couch-lock.

Love the sativa energy boost, great nausea relief, & serious appetite stimulation on come-down. Also great for insomnia.”"

Great chillout strain, with a bit of an energy burst at the end (at least for me.) after finally falling asleep, I slept mostly unperturbed, so its good enough to help insomniacs, late-night workers and mostly sativa-possesing stoners, such as myself n.n  would definitely recommend 😊”"

The high was good but it wasn't very strong or strong at all to be honest.

For us, we decided that we would never buy it again.
Not worth the $50 we put in for it. 

So ya don't buy this if you are looking for something a little strong. This is something for beginners I would say.”"
