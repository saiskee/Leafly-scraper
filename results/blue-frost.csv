demis,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-frost/reviews/1417222,"“I'm a veteran smoker, born and raised in southern Humboldt County, and this is by far my favorite flower. Best smelling, tasting and best high. It's very hard to describe the taste ; but my best description would be blueberry /purple kush/ cheese blend . The high is very nice body high and a powerful "head" high. I recommend this to patients who suffer from depression , pain, anxiety and insomnia to name a few. There...”"

Just  fabulous weed. A blissful evening.  I admire breeders who come up with these remarkable strains.  We have to appreciate the growers as well.  They keep the weed world alive.”"
up2eleven,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blue-frost/reviews/1412060,"“A few months ago, I returned from my non-weed hiatus of at least a decade. Things have definitely changed! I've been exploring various strains to see which works best for me. 

Blue Frost has light and fluffy buds and a mellow scent. The high doesn't hit instantly, but warms up pretty quickly and about 5-10 minutes later you're on the ride. It's got a very nice mix of mellowness and alertness. You're not zonked out a...”"

High starts with an immediate burst of euphoria. Good for relaxing without getting sleepy or couchlocked. Nice mood improver; I like to use a little after work while cooking dinner.

High is really nice, very heady mellow euphoria, some body effects, not at all sleepy. Great first thing in the morning, or anytime of day. Also, will not keep you up like some other morning buds can. Not ideal for falling asleep, but also does not cause trouble falling asleep. Mellows out anxiety, no dr...”"
