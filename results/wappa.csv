Consistently a light green bud with frosty tips and orange hairs.  Strongest bud they have THCA is like 26 I think.  Has a clean weed taste.  Not a gimmicky flavor just a nice full bodied herb.”"

thehappyhorror,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/wappa/reviews/1346689,"“Not for me.  I don't know why, but this strain gives me huge anxiety EVERY time I smoke it. I have no problem with much stronger strains so I'm not sure why wappa makes me trip, but it does. I'm too cheap and broke to throw it out so I have to take xanax everytime I smoke it . I'm actually looking forward to running out.”"
