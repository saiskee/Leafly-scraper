I like to mix with a High-CBD strain (IMC-Blue Suede Shoes) to get the immediate pain and stress relief without feeling stoned or much affected.
It also works well with evening/night strains (IMC - Mr Nice, GG4 or Skywalker) to intensify their sleep-inducing effects.

I smoked it for the first time yesterday with 2 buddies we had only 1.1 - 1.2 grams but still three bowl packs got us nice and stoned.

Very upsetting but not all strains are for everyone.”"

In this case, Pyrethrin.
