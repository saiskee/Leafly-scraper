vitaman,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-god/reviews/1393700,"“Medium sized, dense buds, covered in trichomes. Half a bud was more than a bowlful. Nice scent, I knew I wanted it as soon as the jar was opened. Tasty. EXCELLENT PAIN MED. Definitely couch locked, kind of spacey and scattered.

In terms of anxiety, it's sort of making me a bit anxious, but overall I feel pretty good. I would def recommend this for anyone who has a high tolerance. It's hands down a night time strain.

Lured in by its sticky sweet aroma I partake. Instantly reminded of the tweeked blueberry burst Blue God brings (must be the God bud side of the family). Different from the simple. Far from normal, a wave of honey bear blueberry pinenut saturates my pallet.

All goes well for twenty or thirty minutes and then...

Food and bed. Thats all I could pull off. Paralyzed,...”"
ActualFactual,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-god/reviews/1359136,"“4.5 Stars.  Strong.  Definitely relaxing, great pre-sleep bedtime strain that should be enjoyed for an hour or so before hitting the sack.  Vaped.  Slept amazingly well and had zero grogginess in the morning - or any negative after effects whatsoever for that matter.  Delicious taste and thick lung filling draws.  VERY nice relaxing strain.  Does what it's supposed to as an Indica!”"
TopSarge,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-god/reviews/1290668,"“A good friend of mine procured a bit of this bud for my wife and I and I have to say...he was spot on recommending this strain..  For starters, it is really great looking.  Quite frosty, with quite a few orange hairs running throughout the extremely fat bud structure.  The aroma is a bit on the sweet side with just a little touch of citrus.
I loaded up the grinder and made quick work of rolling a nice joint.  Just li...”"

The buds are dense, and riddled with trichromes and it almost has a purple tint. As the first hit is inhaled, the sweet flavor lingers and gets a tad earthy (which isn't a bad thing).

420druggie,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-god/reviews/1520868,"“To be honest I think this strain makes u a little to tired. I smoked this for my birthday and I couldn't stay up past 12:00. Although it is very high quality weed not so high in Thc levels, I had to smoke about 2 decent joints to get on a good level. Besides that I think it's a great strain and would prefer it over a basic strain any day.”"

after smoking. I mean an intense head rush. It was just complete euphoria and racing thoughts. But alas, it soon showed its Indica side. I became very sleepy and slept for a long time. If you can manage to get some cartoons or anything great in before you fall asleep, it will be well worth it. I hate sleepy...”"

Tonight, to my disappointment, I figured out why the first time was so bad... I didn't smoke enough. To really feel the effects of Blue God (and when you do, they are awesome) I had to smoke a good amount more than other strains. For me, Blue God wasn't worth the price I was charged.

The effects, however, may make you think differently. I felt incredibly rel...”"

khor48,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-god/reviews/1193214,"“Robust smell, classic indica on the nose.  Took a little bit for the high to develop but when it did I found the effects extremely relaxing.  I vaporized in the bath, and could barely get myself out.  Felt like my body was made of lead and I couldn't move, some would say "couch-locked"  Very clear headed, a good body stone that stays below the shoulders.  Top self strain for evening/nighttime and muscle relaxation.”"
nvengance,https://www.leafly.com/indica/blue-god/reviews/1290673,"“this is an awesome strain for pain management and dealing with the inability to sleep. with that said, I use sleep monitoring devices and although I was definitely out cold, my sleep quality decreased and I have a  carryover high till the next day. I would suggest this be used when sick and needing rest, or after a hard day at the gym, or for any type of pain management.”"
