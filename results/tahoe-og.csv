Tahoe OG Kush
=============
Krshna,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/tahoe-og/reviews/1416046,"“This is without a doubt the strongest OG Kush I have ever tried. This is a very heavy, very potent strain of OG. It has the classic OG high but it's markedly stronger than any OG I've had in recent memory.

The smell is the classic OG smell, piney and fresh. Just inhaling this weed lets you know it's dank. You almost cough smelling the buds, the aroma is so potent.

First initial impression is I can really taste the lemon, and the taste of pine and it had a really cool smoke which surprised my lungs. I'm nice and sleepy, have a heavy body high, kind of vibrating and pain free. Mind is calm and relaxed. I notice I pay attention to sound way more, everything is amplified. I can tell I am going to sleep well. I too...”"
