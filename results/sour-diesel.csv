It's all I smoke and I couldn't be happier. I feel sexier, I'm happy, I'm horny, I don't mind eating and yet somehow I'm losing weight. I love moving and doing this. Don't mind doing housework. it's absolute bliss.”"
Dr. Zimbardo,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/sour-diesel/reviews/1418954,"“Another of my personal favorites. Extremely cerebral whenever I consumed it, but, as many others have pointed out, there really is no "couch-lock." It makes your frontal lobe act in ways you could never have imagined. It's almost like Sour Diesel is a key, a key that opens up whole realms of your mind that you were once ignorant of. A++ Will smoke again.”"

Forest green buds with a sparkling shine of crystal coating, the high is invigorating, head-oriented (without being overwhelming), and is sure to leave yr depression desiccated and dying in the desert.
