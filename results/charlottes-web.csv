A smoke melts away my stress, and leaves me with a clear head and the confidence needed to get through my days.  I follow this smoke with a cup of coffee or tea, and feel 110% ready to face the world head-on. Alert, calm, focused.

The prerolls are good too. 

Note though its not as uplifting as higher thc strains... so it will calm you the fuck down, but it wont make you happy unless you mix a little white russian or ak 47 or ATF in it.

snaccman,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/charlottes-web/reviews/1630283,"“I’ve been smoking this strain almost daily for about a month now. Where I buy mine grows it with around 5%-7% THC and around 24% CBD. This makes for a very mild body and head high. It’s a FANTASTIC sleep aid, even though it is a Sativa. Would recommend to anyone who isn’t a huge fan of getting fucked up, but loves the medicinal properties of THC and CBD.”"
LadyMinorB,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/charlottes-web/reviews/1803986,"“This strain is key for me to take the edge off of stress and "negative spiral" thinking. I love high CBD strains, but many times I am provided a package harvested some months ago. Not the case a Curaleaf-Midtown. Nice and fresh, from the top shelf where Charlotte belongs. If you are an early bird like me they offer an AM discount, and the Top Shelf Tuesday deal is great too.”"
