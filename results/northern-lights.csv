I am about at the end of my time here on earth as this disease progresses and the best medicine I have found to relieve the pain has come from this plant.

Your thoughts just flow to you effortlessly. And the relief of my back pain almost made tears of joy come up. I couldn't feel any pain whatsoever(chronic back pain from injury). Doesn't feel like an indica at all. I'm a sativa guy. I need more of this in my life.”"

The effects of the high, wonderful! Everything is lightweight and very floaty. Completely don't give a fuck about anything. Great for anxiety and depression.

From the look of the crystal covered buds, to the flavorful, unmistakable light, fruity flavor a well done Northern Lights is the pinnacle of what I would call, "An old-timers top of the line smoke."

I live with Bipolar Disorder, High Anxiety and PTSD. Most strains I smoke can sometimes leave me being anxious and my head spinning.

A well done crop of Northern Lights should register somewhere in the 22-26% THC zone, and that's plenty strong, for the psychoactive properties of this wondrous flower make it a mind bending experience when smoked.
