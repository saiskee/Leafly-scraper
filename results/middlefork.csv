April 14, 2016

Summary: This is the Haziest Haze of all the Hazes I've ever Hazed!

Well WOW, this comes on like a freight train, but not hard. It just hits fast but it's like a barrage of clouds. Immediately my pain is gone. It's like being transported. No couch lock unless I want to just hang back a...”"

Just ripped half a small bowl and damn I'm baked. Reminds me of a more mellow Girl Scout Cookies, just as potent but more body high and less focused head high. Way less get up and go, but I can see this being great on a rainy day. It's sunny now, and gonna go walk my dog. But I think I found another all-the-time favorite. ...”"
