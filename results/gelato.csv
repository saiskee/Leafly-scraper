It allowed me to relax.. Still hold conversations and made everything feel so great. I took a shower about 20 min after I finish blowing and OMG the shower was amazing.. Then my husband and I had the most amazing lol time together.  This is definitely a favorite.  It will make you sleepy if you give i...”"
errzy,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/gelato/reviews/1417513,"“I know it's an odd statement to make; but this strain made me feel good. But not in that way. It made me feel good...about myself. There should be another label for strain ratings "raises self-esteem" here. This would be my first vote.”"
TickTockCroc,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/gelato/reviews/1415816,"“This has become one of my favourites. Doesn't instantly hit but 20 seconds later it suddenly packs a strong punch. Plenty of euphoria and uplifting creativity. I feel this is a nice all-rounder - you feel both relaxed and calm yet you still have energy to function. I can imagine this to be great for outdoor activities, cooking, or simply just looking to get your mind off things.”"

Hard to find in Southern Cali, know a place in the valley that gets bud from the bay. Incredibly dense and super frosty, with lots of dark purple. Smells and tastes like the sweet dessert it's named from. This cross is a great heady cerebral and euphoric high with some body for relaxing. Amazing unique strain fro...”"

It is 75% of each full experience, but beware: this means you are getting 150% of a high. It is great stuff, and quite trippy. I do not recommend taking this if you are socially anxious a...”"

Outstanding for anxiety halting mind-racing.  Zero paranoia. Pure Focus.  Should be called NZT-48, but the aroma/taste may not appeal to you; 9/10 would bang again.  I would call it Sour Gelato.  I'd like to see a GelatoXGumbo indica monster.  Somebody make this.”"
