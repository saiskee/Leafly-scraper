The flavor is very sweet, with fruity tones. It's got some zing for a Indica dominant strain. I mostly smoke Indica dominant strains, and from time to time I come across one that really stands out and this is one of those strains. This beautiful girl will not give me couch lock instead a nice body high awaits, this bud can induce an active and creative mind making it great for daytime use. This...”"

lawofsin,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/birthday-cake-kush/reviews/1519672,"“I love the effects of this strain. It wiped away my anxiety and depression and relaxed my body. The effects on the mind were pronounced but more indica like. I felt great but clear headed and functional even at high consumption levels. The taste is very reminiscent of GSC. But with a little more fruity of a flavor. Great if you have trouble sleeping or calming the mind. I’d buy again and again.”"

It has numbers that range from 22-26%, and usually has a smaller terpene profile. I don't mind. That simple equation makes for a happy high, helps with inflammation, anxiety, depression, you will want to eat sweets, it is pretty ok for pain, better for pain in the gut regions.

emoteriyaki,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/birthday-cake-kush/reviews/1417562,"“Very solid indica dominant.
Has a clear headed body high that ebbs and flows through in ways that make pain go away, stress evaporate, and offers a nice little buzz throughout. My only negative is that it's not as level headed as GSC and the or offers clarity like Cherry Pie, it's all a bit muddled, the illusion of energy without the wherewithal to actually accomplish anything. 
Also paranoia gets cranked a bit highe...”"
