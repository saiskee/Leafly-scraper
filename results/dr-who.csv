The high is an Indica buzz but I get some hints of Sativa in there which uplifts me and energizes me. What's is cool is the same time tho I could get up and carry on with my day. My fellow stoners this strain is awesome.”"

A very rich velvet smoke with deep earthy notes and a hint of pine in the background.

If I just want to chill and relax I can, or I can get up and go walk a few miles. Great for any time of day! I have crohns disease and it fully takes away my stomach pain allowing me to relax and calm down. I have an appetite and am able to eat after having smoked this. Thank you to the guy at Oasis who recommended this to me 👍”"

The first medical attribute of this is for pain so maybe this is the way to go for cramps. Had dry mouth. Brain felt a little foggy and forgetful but felt like I could still get things done.”"
