GC is always know to provide effects for even veteran consumers after only a few hits. GC is a crowd favorite due to its high potency and overall cerebral invigoration.

GC is probably the most energizing strain of cannabis I've had the pleasure to sample. Just a few hits will have you firing on all cylinders, and just a few more will have you pretty out there. Excellent strain for sativa connoisseurs. Smoked a bowl of it once before work and had a very productive day, to say the least. Great stuff.”"

A green hit tastes okay, anything else tastes bad.
Most notable effect is energy. Nothing else too exciting.
Pretty strong so too much could be dazing or cause a brown out.
Decent for being social as long as you don't have too much.
Overall good, but there's better out there.”"
