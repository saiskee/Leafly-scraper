About a year ago, I stopped taking the pills they were feeding me and got my Medical Marihuana Card.

I ended up picking Flo by accident since the dispensary was out of Bruce Banner, my original selection. Flo didn't let me down.

In flower form, this strain smells like candy. It's the sweetest smelling strain I've come across - so sweet, you'd think the trichomes were actually grannules of sugar. ...”"

The high was strong but not overwhelming. It didn't cloud or even slow my thoughts but energized them and granted them a clarity I would otherwise have to put more effort into to attain. Sort of like a calmer but just as energizing adderall high.

It's a peaceful deep thinking high. I've only done this one alone, but when I do my ADHD calms down and I can sit and just think about stuff. It's possible to be high on this and have intellectual thoughts. I even like to write when I've got Flo in my system.

I became sociable, elated yet relaxed and toward the middle of my high, introspective. I was completely functional during the day. The strain also assisted me in relieving chronic pain in my shoulder.  Personally had a wonderful time sans paranoia or tingly body high which I'm not fond of at all. 

If you're looking for a well balanced high, go with Flo.”"
