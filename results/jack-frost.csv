Beautiful green color with some nice hairs and crystals (frost) intertwined. The smell is amazing...like lemon pledge, with a kind of a cedar accent but nice and citrusy. Tastes great as well and you get that citrus on the finish, especially if you vape it. It hits hard at first then levels off and puts you into a nice easy place. It lasts a loooong time...afte...”"

if i could reach through the other side to another dimension, this weed better be there, because it makes me comment on Marijuana Strains Leafly Page. 

says to self: "any typos? i hope not"

maktown,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/jack-frost/reviews/1417402,"“Definitely one of the stronger strains I've tried. It hits you in phases.
(1) the first phase is that overall feeling of being lost –– I.e. feeling scatter brained without direction
(2) the second stage is this catatonic lethargic floating stage
(3) third stage is ultra horny-ness... awesome strain to have sex on
(4) good night sleepy head.”"
UrsaMajor,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/jack-frost/reviews/1394607,"“An utter delight. A deep, pine green bud that warrants a double take. So humble at first, the richness of the hue is dark, and deep, but not dim. Almost glossy. Green suede, or a holly wreath.

The shade is curious, but the smell is where you really begin to understand. Lavender, lemon, and heady pine make a crisp perfume, far and away from any "skunky" or "sour" notes.

Nugs are hyperdense, being more akin to pebble...”"

Let me just start off by saying that I just tried this strain for the first time last night and my first thought is that it is an amazing green bud. It gives off a really nice euphoric relaxed chilled even high, which is always nice but at the same time it doesn't knock you out or leave you couch locked.

Winter

Smell: Traditional Sativa spicyness, it smells "fluffy". I don't that doesn't make sense, it is what it is.
