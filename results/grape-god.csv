Godbud x Grapefruit. 
Not for being this crazy heavy hitter either, 
but for being the definition of a perfect indica dominant strain.
This medicine acts as both pain relief as well as an anti-anxiety very quickly. With a smoother onset over the body and legs, a calming head high gives a sense of ease making it great choice for a first time patient.
Definitely recommend checking it out!”"

I found this strain was exceedingly helpful with reflection and introspection. Therapy in a bag! 
If you feel you've lost all hope I recommend Grape God! 🍇”"

It is not overly strong, but very balanced both mind and body. The terpene profile definitely has high amounts of linalool (found in lavender and cannabis) which is probably one of the reasons this strain works so well for relaxing the user both mentally and physically.

It smells like a white grape crossed with blueberry (and a hint of mint), and the smell is strong.  The smoke is light and almost has no taste.

Smell of grape is present but faint as it is overtaken by a strong earthy smell. The taste is for the most part earthy while a little hint of grape makes it a pleasant after taste. Very Euphoric initially and as it tapers off a mild stone approaches and lingers into extreme feelings of being mellow for hours after. The buds were dense while still allowing for push.”"

THCWA,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/grape-god/reviews/1390815,"“Grape God is an Indica dominant hybrid (70% Indica x 30% Sativa).  It is excellent for relieving stress and has a nice body high.  The buds are incredibly sticky, very dense, and long lasting in the bowl.  The taste is very fruity and pleasant with no bad after taste.  Everything about is is "grape"; grape taste, grape smell, and grape flavor on exhale.”"

I'm a little new to the cannabis thing and still figuring it all out so maybe take this review with a grain of salt but I got VERY dizzy, it's possible I just got too high too fast but I had severe vertigo that made me nauseous, but that affect did wear off after a little while.

Relaxed body and spirit sensation. The smoke was so pleasant and tasty. Not so "clean" on the inhale, but the flavor came through on the exhale with an almost sourish hint to it. It was very pleasant. The high has been going strong for 1.5 hours. Not one yawn. Not a lick of fatigue or tired eyes h...”"

It's very relaxing but it does make you talk to people. Not so relaxing that you can't move but just enough that makes you feel like you could go for a good nap/sleep. Doesn't taste bad at all. I have the attention span of a rodent when I'm on it though.”"

Considering I smoked the purple kush as well my rating might not be 100% accurate ;). I have smoked a lot of purple kush and I gotta say grape god easily contends, the two highs blended very well imo. I felt pretty euphoric, and was heavily stoned. I give grape god a solid 8/10.
Smoke easy friends :)”"
