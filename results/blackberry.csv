Very energetic and happy high from the sativa side yet with no grandiose euphoria: very giggly and innocent kind of high. I'm high right now and everything is making me laugh, hahahaha. Pretty functional and very clear: good for long creative nights! No disruption in short term memory processing or sensory input (must have high CBD). A very unique a...”"

Pretty dense buds, visually appealing, and light smell pre-smoke. While smoking I definitely felt the head high while it relaxed my body, de-stressed my mind, and made me feel all around better. When riding the high I got hungry, was very relaxed, and just wanted to sleep after a while. When choosing...”"

Creative, relaxed, and couch lazy. Best indica to use if you want to end your night with a great baked spiritual, personal, and body high experience.

As for effects I've seen this strain range around the mid 20 percentile mark and it hits like it.  At smaller doses you'll be bubbly, on the go, and able to function.  While at larger doses you may be comfortably couched locked trying to remember what you had for lunch.  Either way Blackberry is a very enjo...”"
silasbotwin,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/blackberry/reviews/1413130,"“Got the strain crossed with OG Chem, it was superb! Super sweet taste and smell, immediate effects in the mind, thick body buzz hangs around longer, about an hour after the sativa begins to slow it's course. A great strain on it's own, but Blackberry Chem OG is one of the best buds I've smoked in over 5 years.”"

The only down side is the 'one toke over the line' issue.  Two or three hits is enough to stop a rhino.  Anything beyond that will just put you in a staring coma.

The buds were incredibly frosted and gleaning with beautiful purple leaves. Really beautiful buds; I wish I could provide pictures. The strength of the Blackberry was pretty nice and potent, very indica-based and good for nighttime medication.”"

I got this strain in small bud form at Alternatives in Santa Rosa and I have not found any herb that I like better. It is smooth and has a definite blackberry after-taste. I am on dialysis and it really helped my nausea. I felt young again. Thank you Alternatives you guys are amazing.”"

It took a few minutes to come on. Very euphoric yet clear headed, and I did get a bit yawn-y after about 20 minutes. My second dose eliminated pain but motivate me to the mattress.  Smell and taste are just as described.”"
