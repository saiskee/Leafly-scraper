Orange Crush
=============
ContinentalKush,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-crush/reviews/1413676,"“Wow. This strain is crazy. It tastes of citrus very strongly and I love it.  It also smells really potent; it's almost like a dense citrus smell. The high was very exciting for my mind which made me laugh at the slightest out-of-place comments and at the same time was making my head heavy. I also note that I had the halo-head affect which is great. All in all, its a very conversational friendly high which stimulates ...”"
angryjon,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-crush/reviews/1398349,"“Picked up in Seattle.  One of my favorite strains for a general feeling of calm.  Music and surroundings become more engrossing and wonderful probably for the first half hour after use.  After that for usually about the next 2 hours a calm persists, food continues to taste wonderful, and, unique to this strain for me, people all seem to be fascinatingly beautiful.  Comes down easy.”"

Aptly named, it smells like orange peel and pine with a soft, berry air lingering in the nostrils for a bit. Nice looking buds; lime and olive green and absolutely covered in orange hairs. Not very frosty but not without its sparkle either. 
Smoked in my old school double chamber metal pipe it smoked sm...”"
Yescaleaf,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-crush/reviews/1398352,"“Vaped this during 4th of July weekend. While out camping this strain made me embrace the outdoors and definitely made me want to dance all night to the music we had on (Bloc Party). It's not that strong but definitely is a good head high and doesn't last too long which for me is a plus.”"
deadlightbulb,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-crush/reviews/1398353,"“🍊🍋 Orange Crush is a nice and mild sativa-dominant hybrid that is great for anytime use. It really smells like an orange. It's the shotgun of citrus to your nose will leave you wondering if this is laced with pure orange oil. It produces a nice head high that isn't too intense and won't bog you down. It's great for those not looking to get too stoned, but want just enough to get some work done. I personally like to...”"

Sapphyy,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-crush/reviews/1398354,"“Orange Crush is a very social strain. I picked up an eighth of it after I asked the budtender what would be best to smoke before New Years. I was directed toward this strain and not disappointed! The taste was phenomenal! Very citrusy with a bit of an earthy hint. The buds were light green, super frosty, and very fluffy covered in long light orange hairs. The high was very social, heady, and happy. Also very long las...”"
MrRoots,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-crush/reviews/1398355,"“This strain is a must have. best taste for the citrus strains. First hit will leave your mouth watering... at least until the cotton mouth kicks in. She is a fast flower 7.5 weeks for the most flavor. super chunky and full of tricromes.”"

I've been a smoker for 27 years, grew up on the Big Island of Hawaii where there was a ton of flavorful strains but this one by Cannabiotix is by far the tastiest flower I have had the pleasure of smoking. Pure citrus through and through. The high is also top notch, starting with a happy euphoria then transitioning into a very relaxed state of mind, but not couch locked. Orange Crush just jumped into my top 5, p...”"
dan.frampton,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/orange-crush/reviews/1378885,"“This is a bud that reinvigorates my passion for cannabis. Its sharp distinct orange soda smell smacked me in the face. It's not just citrus-y. It's distinctly Orange Crush. A smooth smoke that tastes as good as it smells and leave you feeling energetic and happy as hell. Perhaps climbing the ladder to the #1 strain. Tonight was good!”"

FOR FLAVOR & AROMA, (ORANGE, FLORAL SSSSTRONG FRESH ORANGE ON THE NOSE) AND TRUE MIRROR IMAGE OF ITS NAME, THIS TASTE LIKE A CAN OF ORANGE CRUSH SODA, ALMOST SLIGHTLY CARBONATED (love them smoky burps).  I Have a CRUSH on this strain, excellent for a walk in the sunshine, or for a rainy day, try it... you'll have a new crush too.”"

Orange Crush is one of those flowers that reminds me why I love cannibas to begin with. Extraordinary taste like a smooth orande soda (especially if you add ice to your piece) a exspansive but not harsh smoke and beautiful buds. I really would recommended if your looking for something new.”"

I toked it for the first time last night after a long day and it effectively took all the stress and tension away.  Nice body buzz with a decent amount of head clarity.

At first (even with the indoor stuff) I really couldn't detect more than a slightly sweet smell, however after keeping the indoor stuff in a small airtight container overnight it really brought out a beautiful sweet orange/grapefruit smell.

Somewhat harsh smoke for a Sativa dominant. This strain has a nice cerebral buzz, however it fades to a sleepy feeling. Not a typical "jump up and clean the room" Sativa, but overall a nice smoke. I found this bud was best smoked from a pipe or bong. Dense sticky buds made it harder to roll.”"

Medium sized, tight buds absolutely covered in trichomes and bright orange fibers.
