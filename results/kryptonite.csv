It smokes well and is not harsh on your throat. This weed makes me very lazy, giving me a pleasant body buzz. Great for smoking at night and relaxing.”"

Did not totally kill all of my heavy pain, but got most of it. Makes me feel a little anxious. Won't be a first choice again, but I liked it better than the Pineapple Diesel I also got!”"

hkh5,https://www.leafly.com/indica/kryptonite/reviews/1234093,"“Solid strain for insomnia, especially for a vape pen cartridge. Very very heavy head and body high, doesn't take much before you're out cold. Minimal/slight munchies which is also a plus for nighttime strains - there are some but it's more manageable with this strain. Definitely recommend for anxiety/insomnia.”"
