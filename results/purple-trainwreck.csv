Also I learned how to make the greatest pillow fort in all the land. No girls allowed, just me and my dog Jack (to be fair he came up with the password so I had to let him in).”"

Appearance:  Violet buds with dark red hairs.  Quite frosty.  Looks like sparkling grape candy. 

Initial, almost immediate high, then tapers off into a physical stoney contentedness, then eventually to couch-locky lethargy.

Great go-to for pain relief!  highly effective long lasting pain reliever for a wide variety of ailments.  If you consume a lot, this can also be grea...”"

This was my favorite tasting bud of all time. It's pretty arousing so don't smoke unless you have a backup plan. I wasn't extremely hungry like other indica's but this was the most entertaining and spiritual high I've had in awhile. Helps lighten you're mood when you are upset and usually would have ...”"
M.J.Green,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-trainwreck/reviews/1389362,"“5 star, no doubt, by far my favorite strain I've came across in a while.  Also had an interesting effect, kind of an "adaptive" feel, like if you're on the go it wont slow you down one bit, but if you got nothing to do but sit around, it has good couch-lock potential as well. Very clean lemon/citrus scent with a slight skunky smell as well.”"
Hgresz,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-trainwreck/reviews/1394846,"“This strain is amazing. You will feel very relaxed, and have a mild body high (some tingling). My favorite part of this strain is that is doesn't make you feel stupid like some strains can make you feel. It allows you to keep your common sense but relieves pain, anxiety, and makes you just feel all around good.”"
DarthCannabis,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-trainwreck/reviews/1410222,"“Looks: Crazy.  A bright vibrant violet color with an infestation of trichomes and burning red hairs.  Almost no green and charming to the eye.

Smell: Fruity yet dank.  A mixed variety of scents all recognizable.

Taste: Spicy and strong.  A very pleasurable smoke.

Buzz Type: Heavy head stone.  Similar to that of Trainwreck.

Buzz Length: Long lasting.  2-3 hours.

Overall: One of the only strains I feel s...”"

This one has risen to be one of my favorites. I feel like it consistently works. I find the high very euphoric and narcotic like. I have also been mixing about 2/3 PT with 1/3 Blue Dream and I really like that combination. The Blue Dream adds a little lift and energy to the high.  For me, however, PT does not work well f...”"
Charley_Scheen,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-trainwreck/reviews/1413961,"“Don't let the name fool you. Very good strain.  I've been smoking this for a couple weeks now and overall it's a decent high. Not as much of a crazy high I expected. Not a big fan of purp but it really blend the strain. The taste is very pungent but overall a sweet taste the purp really gives you a mellow body high (not too much). The train wreck keeps you very euphoric and very easy to concentrate.”"

Big dense nugs with lots of purple...a shit load of crystals. Lemon taste. Was a very very nice high very relaxed while maintaining a strong sativa type high.. Not for beginners.”"
newtreehash,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/purple-trainwreck/reviews/1394850,"“Awesome smoke! It starts off with an uplifting happy creative feeling. Then leaves you relaxed and fulfilled. Definitely a great strain for depression and a good nights sleep. I usually smoke it a couple hours before bed and I always get a great night sleep, waking up feeling refreshed. It truly expresses each of its parents.”"

Sweet, piney, and spicy taste, gives you several hours of feel-good activity before lightly settling you down into a gentle couch-lock.”"

A really solid hybrid, if grown right the terp profile is just as impressive as its effects. Great for a bit of Netflix and chill or just chilling watching Netflix.  Keeps the brain turning while sending a euphoric pulse throughout the entire body.  A very relaxing strain but never made me close my eyes, which is something I really look for.  10/10”"

It has the great body effects from the purple which may be overbearing if you smoke too much, leading to a deep couch lock and nap, as well as the uplifting, focused buzz you get from the train wreck, which in my opinion makes for a mix for a great high for pain, nausea, cramps, migraine...”"

I didn't feel like I could do much so I just laid down - which made time go by even slower. I think part of the problem was that I did this at noon. I recommend this one for later in the day.

Tastes like aroma with hash. Expansion is immediate and moderate. Cough is strong but brief. Effect is immediately euphoric and uplifted. Eases into more happiness and relaxation body and mind. Great all day strain for me.
Recommend for creating, frisbee golf, or zoning on a screen.”"

The downside is that it’s not doing anything for my insomnia, nor do I feel very euphoric. The general lack of advertised effects only lets me  give 3 stars to this one.”"

Like I said, the taste is really nice, but the medicinal effects a negligible at best, and some paranoia.”"

The high isnt really there even though it tests fairly high. It is a nice hybrid done right. Uplifting with a hammer. Indugle too much and you can just plant your ass on the couch for awhile and maybe catch a few z's. Taste should match the smell, a dank grapey funk both on inhale and exhale. Try this one out.
