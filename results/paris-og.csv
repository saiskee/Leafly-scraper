A medium to slow come on that gradually grows in pleasure - like an orgasm in extreme slow motion. You may think that’s hyperbolic, but the whole body literally radiates with pleasure. This degree of physical feel good-ness, euphoria, and sensory accentuation -all coupled with an impressive ”goneness” catapult this high into the hallucinogenic echelons of LSD.

Deanoli,https://www.leafly.com/indica/paris-og/reviews/1304519,"“You're definitely getting more of a body high with this strain but you still have real nice cerebral effects peppered in. Also, the strain relaxes you without knocking you out which is a huge plus, its sticly so it'll take longer to grind. I usually pick this up when im heading out for a night with friends. Definitely a good trip to try :)”"
