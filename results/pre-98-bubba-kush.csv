But lately I've been having some new issues with MJ that I've never had before... so this strain was a pleasant surprise. I don't know if my body and hormones are just changing or what, but lately I've become a one-hit wonder and very sensiti...”"

Many of us that grew up in Southern California and during the 'Generation-Y' era feel a deep, personal connection to this strain as we smoked it in many of our early experiences with marijuana.  These genetics first became widely available at some of the 1st medical dispensaries in LA during the 90's.

This is the type of bud you used to get back in the day, and before you smoked it you were thinking the dealer stiffed you with these small popcorn buds. Some things never change.  I keep reading reviews with the same complaint.  Let me explain that this is how pre 98 bubba, and a lot of good kush strains, should look.  This is because the ...”"

Smell (unburned flower):  When you first pull it out it has an almost citrus scent on it.  It smells more like a nice hop used in an IPA (India Pale Ale) than the traditional skunk smell.

It gives you just the right amount of relaxation without leaving you feeling totally stoned. It smells like mild decaf coffee mixed with a forest. It didn't leave me as sedated as I like with my indicas, but I did enjoy the high very much. Limonene: 5.98 mg/g, a-Pinene: 3.95 mg/g, b-Myrcene 0.62 mg/g.”"

This indica is PERFECT after a long work-day, in the middle of the week, for relaxation followed by a deep long sleep.  Zaps pain, anxiety, but can make you lazy.  Personally, I can get a little  anxiety for a few minutes if hit too much, too quick.  However, this drawback is short lived and followed by hours of bliss.
