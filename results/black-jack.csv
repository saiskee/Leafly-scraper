Yes, it makes cleaning "fun," but with the changed sense of time you may be cleaning that toilet for 10 minutes. Makes me feel kind of jittery - like I want to move, but not anxious. I can focus, but also kind of deep space at the same time. I also get pretty warm smoking this stain.”"

I loaded up the "History of the Eagles" on Netflix and loaded up my Pax 2 with the green, crystally bud I had ground up. Black Jack carries a light, grassy aroma that is hardly noticeably, and by paying attention, you can hints of sweet pine in the flavor. After 10 hits or so...”"

This is shatter produced by the company Pure Concentrates.

It is a beautiful amber honey color. It has more of a pull and snap consistency. If you just pull is slowly it strings out.
