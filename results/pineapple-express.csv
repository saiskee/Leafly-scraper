I can accomplish anything on Pineapple Express while still enjoying a nice head high and the giggles. I get very talkative on this strain and come up with some genius ideas and am able to think about things in a new light. Almost like being able to think freely without the stresses of life taking over. Love it!”"

With pineapple express I get a nice relaxed body buzz but I am still clear headed and totally calm and slightly euphoric.  I suffer from bipolar disorder and schizophrenia and find that this strain doesn't aggravate my symptoms.  It is also nice for spiritual use as it helps you feel one with everything....”"

A pleasant bouquet. Not intoxicating. Slightly rosy in smell. Pineapple Express would make a killer potpourri, and then you could smoke it too.
I will say that P Express doesn't hit as fully on the vaporizer as much as other buds, like Sour D or Kandy Kush, nor is it as tacky to the fingers. Its not a crystal blown out bud(at least this batch)...”"
