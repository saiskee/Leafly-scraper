TerryWallace,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/lemon-haze/reviews/1416312,"“A definite favorite of mine, in the top 3 out of all the different strains I have tried.
The buzz was quiet long, but I didn't have that much so it could have been much longer. It went down so smooth I would gladly swap this for air if I could. And to top it off, it tastes amazing.
There are not many strains better than this one, with everything positive and it cured my depression, lack of appetite and pain.
I tri...”"

Not only is it similar to Jack Herer in that regard, but it also shares the wide-eyed vision. Although...instead of Jack’s soaring euphoria, this is more beaming cheeriness.

Stress and depression are no match for this herb, which fills your brain with happiness and euphoria without turning your brains to mush.

Lemon haze lasts around 2 hours for me with great physical and emotional pain relief. No stress or Sadness. Incredibly happy throughout the entire high. Wonderful taste as well. A sudden lemony taste then a great grapefruit after taste. I give this a 10.”"

It didn't leave me completely stupid and I was able to hold conversations and comprehend what people were saying. Lemon Haze is one of the few strains that can make it difficult to walk in a straight line. It's also really sexually arousing. Like..very. Which is fine because it doesn't make you go stupid or lazy.”"

After a while I felt really creative and a big wish to discover and read articles about all what popped into my mind.
Another day I smoked it and then went to a City Museum. This weed made me feel really "Cultural".

Happy, giggly and motivated, this herb gives a good manageable high. Taken to excess, my brain was buzzing, burning, feeling confused and anxious. Regular hits give me focussed and happy sanity rather than the box of howler monkeys trying to pass for my brain.”"

Awakening to the mind and senses this strain is best enjoyed with morning tea or breakfast to start the day with an energizing burst.  Smelling the flowers prior to enjoying the smoke is key to activating the full aromatic potential.  The strong notes of lemon invigorate the mind to be alert.  Gets the appetite activated.”"

I'm usually not a fan of sativas but this one was killer and it has given me literally no burn out every time I have smoked it. Would defiantly recommend to others as a day time strain and I can see why this won the 2008 cannabis cup.”"
