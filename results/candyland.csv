After medicating I felt completely at ease and relaxed. It was a great body stone that I have fallen in love with. It took away all pain and stress and allowed me a chance to get a decent nights rest. This will be my go-to strain from now on. Bloom Phoenix totally got this strain perfect.”"

TickTockCroc,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/candyland/reviews/1338650,"“My tolerance at the moment is extremely high, and it takes something powerful to let me feel medicated. This is that and more. Candyland packs a punch - it SHOOTS me to the stars! You feel euphoric, creative, and in a dream-like state, without feeling too heavy. It later mellows out with indica-like effects, good for a peaceful and relaxing sleep.”"
purplepalmtrees10,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/candyland/reviews/1338663,"“This strain was pretty fantastic. Sativa with some purplish/pinkish leaves, amber/orange hairs and a nice amount of crystals on the outside. A nice smoothe grapish/fruity flavor with a nice smoothe high. When pulling a bud of this apart to put in the grinder it was more purple/pink and white on the inside..  love this strain.”"
