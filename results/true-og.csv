Aroused, possibly. Depends on where your mindset is when you go into the high. Easy to laugh. Relieves stress a little, to the point where you're calm about it, but you still know you have to do something about it. Aware. Overall good high. Doesn't help with sleep TO much though.”"

I purchased this strain at Medicine Man Medical Market located in Glendale Colorado. The initial sting of its aroma was pungent and had a light citrus waft to it, it was very pleasant. The density of the buds, the aroma, and the visual aesthetic was very pleasing.
