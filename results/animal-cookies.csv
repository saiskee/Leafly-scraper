If you're a girl you may be going through this too, regular over the counter pain medicine doesn't help me. This knock out my pain after the first two hits, it kind of sends your body off and makes it feel as if you're floating. This strain makes your body feel tingly and light. I would definitely use this strain for anything pain related.”"
DrDrea,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/animal-cookies/reviews/1417657,"“While GSC is still my preference, after spending an afternoon indulging in this strain to a point of near tweaking, I have to say it was very enjoyable.  Not overly arousing, which is something I'm always on the lookout for, but highly visual much like the Fire OG from which it is born though a bit more subtle when consumed at a low to moderate level.  I, however, went all out and noticed that, when writing text, the...”"

So far, I'm liking this one quite a bit.  I've tried Thin Mint Cookies before, which I very much enjoyed, so I was excited to try this one.  I am not disappointed!

I found this made cleaning my house much more enjoyable.  But I do notice that if I'm a bit tired, or if I relax to watch a movie or TV show, it's likely that I'...”"

I have had, and been pleased by, GSC and platinum GSC but somehow animal cookies just didn't do it for me. The bud was well cured, trimmed, and did smell delightful.  However the high was just average at best and left me with a feeling of wanting to continue to smoke more because I was expecting a face melter and never got it. I cannot say it was the grow...”"

The bud has a light green color to it with fiery red hairs spread around thanks to the Fire OG genetics. The smell is very aromatic and on the sweet size. It's the kind of smell that when you open a jar of it and put your nose inside, it feels like you're in heaven.
