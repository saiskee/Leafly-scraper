Romulan

Brian,https://www.leafly.com/indica/romulan/reviews/1412730,"“The Rom dropped a bomb on my head. Not the smartest idea to take my portable vaporizer loaded up with this particular strain to a bowling alley. Needless to say, I quickly lost interest in the repetitiveness of throwing a heavy ball down a strip of greased flooring. It was one of those midnight bowling situations where they turn the lights down...I simply felt the need to just put on my sunglasses anyway and observe ...”"
MellowSailor,https://www.leafly.com/indica/romulan/reviews/1413562,"“I am pretty picky in what strains I medicate with and have tried all kinds, but Romulan is one of my all-time favorites.   I am very specific in the effects I want to feel. I need cannabis to 1) Calm my stomach/intestines immediately and take away nausea - and - 2) Provide me with a mellow, manageable high that does NOT induce paranoia or anxiety.  I have severe IBS, GERD and a host of other intestinal issues, so a h...”"

Romulan. There is a slight spicy, peppery aroma. 

+0:00; smokes evenly, but hit quite harshly. Taking smaller, controlled and even hits worked best to avoid a coughing fit. Smoke tastes spicy, not much taste of 'grass'.

Arminite,https://www.leafly.com/indica/romulan/reviews/1418563,"“A strong body high, with high couchlock, perfect for pain, anxiety, and insomnia. Makes me feel like someone is massaging my muscles from within my body; sometimes it feels like there is electricity tingling down my limbs. Very effective for my chronic shoulder and neck pain. The pain is transformed into a sensation of heat that is not nearly as bothersome. My favorite effect Romulan has is that it intensifies audito...”"

To put it simply, when you smoke it, you're in a battle with gravity and you will NOT win, so don't bother trying to fight it. When I stood up I just immediately sat back down because my body was jello. Once I laid down in my bed, it felt like I was float...”"
Defro81,https://www.leafly.com/indica/romulan/reviews/1418564,"“I have horrible nerve pain in my legs from a spinal injury. This strain takes that pain away within minutes. I have let a few of my friends who also have nerve pain, they have all had the same results. If you suffer from nerve pain issues, this stuff works miracles.”"
jessi.chval,https://www.leafly.com/indica/romulan/reviews/1373062,"“This standard of excellence, against which I measure all other indicas, is my go-to pain reliever. Romulan melts my face. Every time. Night time use only, unless I have a migraine or cramps. I have been smoking this strain for so long that I can tell by smell when anything else I get has been crossed with it.”"
organicsarcasm,https://www.leafly.com/indica/romulan/reviews/1384023,"“IMHO, this is a strain made just for me by the ganja gods. They smiled down upon me and blessed me with this legendary Canadian strain. It does exactly what I want it to, obliterates my pain, keeps me super mellow, and knocks me out at the end of the day. I've been waiting years for it to come around my source and I cannot be happier about it.”"
Heath,https://www.leafly.com/indica/romulan/reviews/1383392,"“romulan is my absolute high...  just took 4 hits after a long day at work ... ahhhahhh relaxation, stress rolls right off kinda getting a little hungry.  mainly for me is a very relaxing "weew" kind of feeling that nothing else can beat !  I rate it at a 15 !  ;O)”"
Mickey77,https://www.leafly.com/indica/romulan/reviews/1370107,"“LOVE!!!!!! It's a great indica. Helps me sleep, relieves my pain and gives me an appetite. I use this along with their Rick Simpson Oil to treat severe muscle spasms and nerve pain from MS, RA and brain disorder, epilepsy. I feel better than ever! I'm able to get out and enjoy life again. :) Oregon Medigreen has me feeling great!”"
CMPhealing,https://www.leafly.com/indica/romulan/reviews/1393438,"“Super easy, mellow high. As one of the other reviewers said, it feels like you're wrapped in a blanket of pain relief. It does wonders for my mobility and fine motor skill issues caused by Parkinson's.”"

DancerDJ,https://www.leafly.com/indica/romulan/reviews/1382758,"“Romulan: happy, anti-anxiety, relaxed; I use this one after, or to curb, an anxiety attack as it makes me happy and calm without the jittery stimulants i sometimes experience from a hybrid, or sativa is worse for making my anxiety sensations worse, if I'm already in an anxiety-triggered state. Rom is a my default strain for evening relaxing or for alleviating anxiety.”"
friendlykrueger,https://www.leafly.com/indica/romulan/reviews/1374731,"“This is hands down my favorite indica strain at the moment. I've had multiple examples from different growers and they have all been exceptional. Aroma has varied from cherry candy to concord grapes. Definitely some amber notes too. Once smoked, the flavor always leans cherry candy for me. Normally I'm more into hashy, dieselly, cheesey smelling strains, but Romulan pushed me out of my normal pattern. For me, the hig...”"
Dabmas721,https://www.leafly.com/indica/romulan/reviews/1363234,"“This is some pretty good weed. It begins by existing in fucking beautiful little frosted nuggets that smell absolutely delightful. They smoke extremely well and taste wonderful. It hits really hard, but it's not at all of a debilitating high. You'll feel curious and as if things are breathing at you. Taking a walk is orgasmic. This is also perfect for a pre-sleep toke. If you lay down you'll slip into comfort heaven....”"

FlowerPower_,https://www.leafly.com/indica/romulan/reviews/1410833,"“Real Romulan is an incredible strain, if you can find it! Here's how you can tell- The Taste : very piney/lime(NOT LEMON,) skunky, with a very distinct  GRAPE WINE aftertaste on exhale. If you don't taste all of these things - it is not real Romulan.  The  high is both cerebral and body at the same time, with a calming effect of no other strain except Columbian Gold. This is in fact due to the actual COLUMBIAN GOLD g...”"

While filling my bowl I was suffering from some severe shoulder pain that was stressing me out and in turn creating a fair amount of insomnia but this beauty melted it all away.  The high came on surprisingly quickly and conitued to rise for around half an hour before sedating me and leaving my mind in a blissful, although forgetful, state.  Romulan has become on...”"
weazal,https://www.leafly.com/indica/romulan/reviews/1382759,"“Comes on like a sledgehammer to the head. Big, weighty physical feeling around the head. Vision is nicely brightened with good vibrancy and wide focus - almost like looking through a wide-angled lens. Headspace is focused and energized.

volcomliberation,https://www.leafly.com/indica/romulan/reviews/1103893,"“This was the most intense high I've ever experienced. I smoked two big bowls and I was in another dimension. I was so spaced out I didn't even know where I was (I was on my couch in my apartment playing Gears of War 3 with a friend). It has a great smell to it, piney, yet sweet.

joAmo,https://www.leafly.com/indica/romulan/reviews/1310536,"“This is sure to live up to its name. As described above for Romulan, this turns out to weigh heavier per nug for a given reason. More dense, compacted and sure to attract the naked eye. This strain provides the couch kickoff several hours even if you do decided to move and run errands.
