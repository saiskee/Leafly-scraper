The smell grosses me out, and almost every strain I've tried makes me nauseous, anxious, and paranoid, and then completely knocks me out. Indicas are the worst, I seriously can't handle those at all. Sativas are better, but they still don't feel good. With a weird spinal deformity (I have an extra vertebrae that's broken and grinds) that causes unbearable pain in my lower back a...”"

Good choice for pain, works great for anxiety, and quite fun. It also has the added benefit of arousal! A great all ar...”"

Judio,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/cinex/reviews/1417695,"“I never write reviews on Leafly anymore, but f*** it, Cinex deserves it. Badass strain, my favorite of 2016 hands down. Only smoked flower of this strain once but it was bomb. The concentrate form of this strain, however, is actually what I want to talk about today. 

For about a month, Cinex wax was all I smoked. The wax had a really gooey consistency, had a thc content of 82% as I recall, and I could always get it ...”"

With Cinex, you get that nice mood boost without paranoia/anxiety of some of the more popular Sativas. I felt like my problems and worries were washed away, and I was actually much more motivated and productive.

The effects are pure sativa, but I imagine the indica in Vortex blunts some of the raciness of pure sativas.  Cinex is excellent for interacting with the world. I evenI won at 3-handed pinochle on a little bit of this. Smoke  more and it can be a great cerebral high: increasingly good mental shift, complete loss of time perception, an...”"

It helps with the pain, although not as deeply as an Indica does for me (like Orion's Belt, which I like to take a puff of before bedtime).. it's more of a "forget" you're having pain feeling. I get very energetic and clean the house, work on projects that I've been putting off. I get very aware of my surroundings, like noticing things tha...”"

I used to enjoy smoking during daylight hours, too, but as of late I have not been.

Cenex is a solid strain if you're looking to get things done.  Whether you're on your feet or behind a desk this strain will keep you going like the energizer bunny.

This strain reminds me of the first  times I really enjoyed the high. I have been smoking for 44 years and it takes me back to those days when it seemed easy to achieve a long lasting high that almost cripples you. I highly suggest this for pain relief.

Smell: VERY earthy, almost spicy

Taste: definitely spicy, with a pungent background to it

Probability of munchies: medium

Effects: very euphoric and uplifting mentally, and very light and tingly on the body. This strain is a hit or miss with anxiety, I find it borders on the "too up-itty" feeling that can set off panic attacks in some, so tread carefully if your treating anxiety. In smaller doses though, th...”"

Well, Cinex is THE strain that helps my adhd. Two or three hits and I feel uplifted, focused, and mildly energized. Not the strain to "get high" with or bring to a party, but has great medicinal potential. For that alone I have to give top marks.”"

W#as waited on by manager Adam, what an angel.  The girl at the window
was very nice; just a nice "trip" all the way around.  The Cinex works on my back like a tonic....can't explain it.  I noticed there was the slightest bit more moist to it, just perfect.  Thanx for a great experience, "I'll Be Back"!!

I clearly got a batch on the earthy end of the taste spectrum - not for me.  I wouldn't turn it down if someone handed some Cinex to me; but with the plethora of choices with flavors I like better, this one goes into the "never again" column.  I'd probably feel different had I lucked out and gotten a batch on the citrusy side.”"
