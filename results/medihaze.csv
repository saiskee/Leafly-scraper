I didn't know what to expect so I made sure it was a strain I tried with a freshly rested mind. The smell and taste was very spicy and earthy... honestly kind of reminds me of the old school pretendo that used to float around. The high is fantatsic. There needs to be more CBD in strains because for such a low percentage of THC (4.76%), MediHaze has a wonderful high an...”"

Nice smell, smooth smoke, effects come on around 10-15mins later. Nice and alert, good low dose thc makes the head tingle a little but great for daytime and being social. Uplifting high and a great pain reliever. A perfect intro for people new to medical marijuana about feeling the psychoactive effects. So this for me (new here) love it...”"

It helps with my physical pain and keeps my anxiety at bay, while maintaining a clear head. No feeling high, just a pleasant, comfortable, chillness. 
It does cause me major dry mouth, very mild (and tolerable) nausea, and suppresses my appetite.”"

Tathagata,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/medihaze/reviews/1382329,"“Medi Haze is a great strain for daytime use, with a light, uplifting buzz which helps with focus.

Medi Haze has a strong, sweet strawberry/slightly skunky smell. The taste is similar, with a light peppery taste on the exhale.

lovethehaze,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/medihaze/reviews/1328712,"“Great strain for daytime use for people with social anxiety issues. I personally make oil and eat it in edibles and found that 1/2 ounce will get me 100 doses but I take 2 staggered by 15 minutes and I'm good for about 3 hours or so. Very happy social high with virtually no burn out!! Love the haze , any haze will do!!”"
necrosophy,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/medihaze/reviews/1418948,"“One of the only sativas that I like! I'm a hardcore indica girl. This stuff wipes me clean, my brain is nice and blank. Sure, creativity would be nice, but I'm smoking it to get rid of bad thoughts. And this stuff will do it. Works on depression. Had a bit of anxiety but it went away quickly.”"

nvcainz,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/medihaze/reviews/1258941,"“Outstanding. I typically avoid the lower THC strains, but with the high CBD content, this flower gets a big thumbs up for relaxation, meditation and it's fantastic for headaches.”"
lilbluesmurf,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/medihaze/reviews/1285573,"“This strain was my first encounter with high CBD bud, and it probably is not the strain for me. My bud tested at about 5% THC, 11% CBD. I took my standard number of vape hits to check it out. The taste was interesting, kind of a peppery soil flavor. There was just enough of a head high to make me feel paranoid and a little agitated for about an hour, and I got all warm and flushed. I didn't feel any significant pain ...”"
Vuki63,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/medihaze/reviews/1301594,"“This is a very good strain for treating pain. I use this during the day and it allows me to remain quite functional while providing effective pain relief and an overall relaxed feeling. I have used the high CBD/low THC phenotype of this strain and I would definitely recommend it for moderate pain relief and stress relief.”"
Cannonfodder,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/medihaze/reviews/1358668,"“Great strain!! Not much of a psychoactive feeling at all. Clearheaded buzz and great for pain and anxiety as well. Also helps to create an appetite for those that are looking for a non-psychoactive appetite boost. The one I got was 7% CBD and only a 2.41% THC content.”"

The first few times, I never felt a heady effect which was nice for me. My heart did speed up for a few minutes. A warm relaxation washed over my whole body. Pain seemed to be far off. I took the stairs 2 at a time. so far, so good.”"
uredatrightbeech,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/medihaze/reviews/1313791,"“Love this strain. I'm more of an indica guy but this strain is good. Pine sweet smell lifts you up and puts you in good mood. Light head high that will keep you up for the day.”"
RogueFembot,https://www.leafly.com/sativa/medihaze/reviews/1365163,"“As someone with chronic pain due to PTSD/GAD I have to say this strain is absolutely magical.

The CBD/THC ratio was about 2:1, though still low (6% to 10%) and yet after just a couple of little pipe hits I had instant relief. My back loosened up, muscle knots I had for years shrunk in size, and I was in a more relaxed state of mind. This strain has done wonders for me and I would highly suggest it for anyone in a si...”"

For the record : upon further examination of obtained bud from my local dispensary I believe it was poorly grown. Even discovered some seeds. Nothing like tjs cbd which is the most chronic crystalline skunky packed with medicine cbd I have found yet. My medihaze had zero pain relieving or anti inflammatory relieving effects of any kind. Anti anxiety forget it. But like I said...”"

This strain does offer some psychoactive effects but very mildly, you will get a pleasant relaxation throughout your body and muscles  due to the CBD content.

highly recommended for Sativa Lovers!”"

It immediately takes any slight back pain that I usually have away and also gets me high enough to where I can still function normally but still have a fun crazy spinny head thing going on. Tastes very fruity and sweet!”"
