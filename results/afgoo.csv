Used with a vaporizer, the buzz lasts quite long and can get your body active. A cerebral uplift generating from the eyes and front of head, followed by a kicker of a moderate body high. A good overall strain, and I feel can be compared with White Widow.”"
HiSience420,https://www.leafly.com/indica/afgoo/reviews/1390640,"“WOW! Take a look at these pics after you read this. This 2.5 gram nug of afgoo is mildly dense, mostly the core, but the outer portion is spongy with long brown hairs. Exceptionally pure organic eathy/pine like smell, with a flavor that continues through out the hit. Unlike most strains for me, the exhale still holds its flavor through all the bowl. This smoke is the kind of high you want In the afternoon or for bed....”"
BakedBuffalo,https://www.leafly.com/indica/afgoo/reviews/1390644,"“This is my first time trying this bud, so I had no expectations but this strain is a solid indica. Afgoo's characteristics make it a great indica for those who want something heavy, but not something that will completely incapacitate you. The sweet piney smell from this bud is extremely enjoyable. The buds have a noticeable darker, earthier look and the smoke is pretty harsh on the lungs.

The reason I enjoy Afgoo so...”"

ajr819,https://www.leafly.com/indica/afgoo/reviews/1344097,"“This is my favorite indica. For those who deal with chronic aches and pains, the almost instant body high that afgoo provides is unlike any other indica strains I have tried. It stimulates the mind for a good hour or two which helps process the day or brainstorm new ideas about life. After a bit of intermittent smoking, bed time or a nap feels great. Do not take this if you are looking to be active and in public. Thi...”"
