I smoke marijuana for medicinal properties. As a result, I have an extremely high tolerance for THC and typically do not ever get to feel the high that I used to get when first starting out. There is a secret to Berry White that I must share. 

First and foremost, use a grinder with Berry White. The reason is because there are so m...”"

It looks beautiful and is covered in Orange hairs with somewhat of a white haze covering the rest of the bud. Smells sweet and pungent like any good weed does. When you smoke it it has fine sweet taste that is enjoyable. Smoked it out of a bong and took about 4 big hits. Found myself coughing for a good 5 minutes on the last hit that's when I knew I was good. Started off with a hyper induced ha...”"
FriedTaters,https://www.leafly.com/indica/berry-white/reviews/1669431,"“This strain is good.i like it just fine, but in very small amounts. It's a little heavy on the indica for my brain. I smoke maybe 2-3 times a week, but when I do smoke, one of its parent plants, white widow is my go-to. It only takes one hit and I'm good for 4-5 hours. Generally I game after I smoke, but berry white makes it damn near impossible. This will be my bed time strain for sure.  This stuff is a lot more den...”"
droidkiller73,https://www.leafly.com/indica/berry-white/reviews/1498505,"“Berry White.... With parent strains Blueberry and White Widow I had high hopes for this indica leaning strain... and I was not disappointed! 

In the jar: Being that it leans indica the bud structure wasn’t as tight as I expected and I could certainly see some of the sativa side that was passed on from the White Widow parent. The smell is a bit earthy/berry with a weird funk that I can’t quite figure out what is, but...”"

LorDoza,https://www.leafly.com/indica/berry-white/reviews/1365473,"“Strong, pungent lemonade smell when ground up. Smoke is fair on the throat. A sweet, floral taste that is very mild. A bit of a zest to it though. Immediate head high and stoned feeling. A nice indica that places it's Blueberry parents' quality flavor  directly on your palate. A very vibrant strain. Overall 4.5/5 in my books”"
potprincess2000,https://www.leafly.com/indica/berry-white/reviews/1319169,"“Berry White has become one of my favorites. The flowers have a sugary cookie and berry scent. Very rosey, earthy and rich. The taste is very fresh however it can be a bit nauseatingly sweet with heavy pills. The Blueberry and White Widow genetics make this a very  STRONG strain. It has an almost immediate effect with intense muscle relaxation and a very pleasant heaviness. This medicine is deeply mellowing and relaxi...”"

It smokes super easy...the Berry White.  Like smoking a fine mist of air, with a piney aroma and taste.  Easiest I have ever smoked.”"
