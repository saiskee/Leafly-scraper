I have really bad anxiety and trouble concentrating on a good day and not all buds are good for that. I'm very hesitant with new strains and after trying Space queen I fell in love. Literally. I like to do things while I smoke. Be productive.. And enjoy it. I don't like the super strong couch coma buds. This one was clean and amazing and just great. Absolutely no paranoia or frantic...”"

Quite a nice mixture of, "Wtf...Hmm...", a new book, spicy potpourri, faceplanting into a floral arrangement, and a delicious sweetness from unknown fruit(s). I have never come across anything that has smelled like this. This is one of a kind. A lovely sativa-dominant hybrid with a high that is uppity and uplifting. This is a perfect strain simply for existing as a human be...”"

Mikayla,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/space-queen/reviews/1189543,"“Tried a pre-roll, anymore than 2 to 3 drags is too much, it can cause a definite strong head high, even stupefying if ya abuse it.

Will use it again!”"

I had a Super Skunk x Space Queen cross breed, and it was literally the happiest high ever, I was singing and dancing a little bit too. I was talkative. And impressed with really little things. So much fun. Highly recommend, it will peak your interest in things.”"

GnarlyBrownie,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/space-queen/reviews/1276715,"“After just smoking this im already feeling a nice mellow high. Body is definitely relaxed and I'm not as anxious as I was previously.

Not as heavy as a high as I was expecting but does give my a lot more to think about.
Trying to be productive doesn't seem that much more difficult either but it's organizing everything into a more workable plan that I seem to be troubled by. 

Other than that I can't really complain....”"

DragCoon,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/space-queen/reviews/1319815,"“It's the closest thing to a sativa I can really enjoy. An energetic, but relaxed buzz. I most liked it when I combined it with Afghan and suddenly felt like a little kid again with my friend there to babysit me. That was incredible, though I think it's at least from the AK as the SQ.

One thing, though. It tastes like parmesan cheese. I've never been particularly discriminating about taste, but once you get the idea ...”"
fettfan91,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/space-queen/reviews/1110579,"“this strain wastes no time taking effect. a couple rips from the bong and you have the same chances of either going outside for a game of basketball or spending two hours on the internet. excellent head rush - glad to see everyone agrees on that. small inconvenience - will turn your eyes into rubies; bring drops.”"
peeettaaarrr,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/space-queen/reviews/1110618,"“Felt it in my head first, then it spread from there. Definitely a head high, and definitely worth trying. Not the best flavor, but the high overcomes that. Can't wait for more :)”"

As a marijuana enthusiast, you could say, I would have to note that the high doesn't hit you immediately. It takes its time, and once you realize you're high, you have been for a while. One can also function pretty normal on this particular. Overall, I'd recommend this to anybody, it's just great!”"

Many of the Kush strains have been bred to the point of being very good but all somewhat the same. 

This Marijuana still has some "snap" in it and its effect. Very good change of pace and very good marijuana.”"
