SkyTripper,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/banana-kush/reviews/1415181,"“Picked up some Banana Kush the other day and WOW!
This lime green, nice-smelling bud just wasted me after about 4 good rips on a bowl.  The high creeps in after about 5 or 10 more minutes and left me all zoned out, like I was on a mild acid trip.  Hell, I've been tokin for 30 years too!
Old school bud for sure.
This bud puts a big smile on my face, left me talkative & sociable, tripped way out, seeing things, hear...”"

I've been smoking daily for the last six months, so I've built up a minimal tolerance.  I packed a bowl and after three hits I was gone.  I hadn't been that high off such a small amount in a while.

Gave me a short case of the munchies, but nothing I couldn't ignore.  I did find that sitting was a must, and lying down equa...”"

I suffer from  high anxiety, and depression,  ocd and who knows what else.  lol  So, I have been trying different blends.

Believed to have originated in California, this indica domininant strain is one of the gentler OG's I've had. The banana certainly comes through, even in a pre-roll. While I found my appetite to be stimulated as well as my anxiety muted, at no point did I feel overwhelmingly tired or exhausted, making this a great day time indica. The most beneficial medica...”"

The perfect combination of clear-mindedness and ease of concentration while simultaneously feeling really different/high. I felt motivated and didn't have couch lock (but that may have been from recent coffee).

The most noticeable effect: While my perception stayed coherent - not muddy or fuzzy - it felt like it slid sideways. As though you're experiencing life the way your uncle perceives it. R...”"

It seriously smells like bananas, but the high is much more desired for than a yellow, dong-shaped fruit from Ecuador. This just may be the most relaxing strain I have ever indulged in.

I suffer with Lupus, RA, Anxiety, etc. I'm always worried about anxiety attacks with any strain, even if the strain "helps with anxiety" I will still have an attack.

Jyonna,https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/banana-kush/reviews/1481724,"“This strand is amazing. Im usually on the quiet side and just let people talk as I enjoyed my high nodding in agreement to something I forgot I agreed to in the next 30 second but as soon as I hit this I couldn't stop talking . I was saying anything that came to mind and it made me a goofy philosopher as well. Relaxed in the hands and arms and very clear in the head. I like it. I think I'll buy it again for sure.”"

In terms of plant structure, the flowers are dense, high calyx count and short node spacing, with a brilliant green color showing through all the swollen reason glands. It's almost as nice to look at as it is to smoke.

The flavor is excellent. The spicy, earthy flavor on the exha...”"

It's like the nug is covered in sugar with the amount of trichomes all over it. Super dense and once ground up, the scent becomes even stronger and fruitier.
